                <hr class="light">
                <p class="text-faded">I am a master’s student at Northwestern University’s Robotics program (MSR),
                    expected to graduate in the fall of 2021.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">I started my professional journey by gaining valuable hands-on experience as an electrical technician in the
                    Israeli Defense Forces and later as a mechanical engineer in both enterprise and defense technology applications.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">Looking forward, I wish to continue growing and challenge myself by joining the emerging world of robotics.
                    <br>I am especially interested in autonomous robotics, machine learning and SLAM, and looking for job opportunities in related areas.</p>
