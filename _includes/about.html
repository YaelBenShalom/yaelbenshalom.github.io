                <br>
                <p class="text-faded">I am a master’s student at Northwestern University’s Robotics program (MSR),
                    graduating in the fall of 2021.
                </p>
                <p class="text-faded">I started my professional journey by gaining valuable hands-on experience as an
                    electrical technician and technical program manager in the Israeli Defense Forces and later as a
                    mechanical engineer in both enterprise and defense technology applications.
                </p>
                <p class="text-faded">Looking forward, I wish to continue growing and challenging myself by joining the
                    emerging world of robotics.
                    <br>I am especially interested in robotics manipulation, autonomous mobile robots, controls,
                    planning, perception, and SLAM, and looking for job opportunities in related areas.
                </p>
