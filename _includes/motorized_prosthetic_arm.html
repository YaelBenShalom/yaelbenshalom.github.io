                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>In this project, I designed, built, and controlled a motorized prosthetic elbow that imitates healthy arm motion to help amputees prevent falling,
                        avoid injuries, and maintain balance while walking.
                        According to Kent and Major's research$^{[1]}$, asymmetries in body mass and motion affect the regulation of whole-body angular momentum in
                                individuals with upper limb absence and may increase fall risk.</p>
                    <p>To better predict the arm-body motion, I analyzed arm movement data patterns, simulated full arm dynamics, and found the relation between walking speed to the angular velocity of the arm.</p>
                    <p>Take a look at the project on my <a

                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>This project contained 3 parts:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Data collection</li>
                        <li>Arm motion analysis and modeling</li>
                        <li>Motor control to achieve the desired arm motion</li>
                        <li>Mechanical design of the prosthetic elbow</li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Data collection</h4>
                    <p>In the data collection part of the project, I focused mainly on measuring prosthetics characteristics and collecting body-arm motion data.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h5>Prosthetics Measurements</h5>
                    <p>To get the size and mass of an average prosthesis, I measured more than 20 different prosthetic arms. To find the center of mass (COM) location,
                    I used a center-of-mass estimation system$^{[1]}$. The system consisted of a wooden board with nails on both sides and a digital scale.
                    One side of the board was located on the scale, and the other side was located on a leveled table.</p>
                    <p>In the first step, I measured the center of mass of the wooden board:</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <img src="../img/portfolio/motorized_prosthetic_arm/COM_calculation1.png" width="50%">
                    </p>
                    <p class="img_description">The free-body diagram used to calculate the COM of the prosthesis</p>
                    <p>The COM of the board can be derived from the Torque Equilibrium equation of the system above:
                    $$ \sum M_1 = F_1 \cdot L_S - W_B \cdot L_B = 0 $$
                    $$ L_B = \frac{F_1 \cdot L_S}{W_B} $$
                    Where $ W_B = m_B g $ is the weight of the board.
                    </p>

                    <p>Similarly, the COM of a prosthesis can be found by locating it above the wooden board and examining the change Torque
                    Equilibrium equation, as described in the following image:</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <img src="../img/portfolio/motorized_prosthetic_arm/COM_calculation2.png" width="50%">
                    </p>
                    <p class="img_description">The free-body diagram used to calculate the COM of the wooden board</p>
                    <p>We can derive the COM of the prosthesis from the Torque Equilibrium equation of the updated system above:
                    $$ \sum M_2 = F_2 \cdot L_S + W_P \cdot L_P - W_B \cdot L_B = 0 $$
                    $$ L_P = \frac{F_2 \cdot L_S - W_B \cdot L_B}{W_P} $$
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h5>Body-Arm Motion Measurements</h5>
                    <p>To explore the body-arm motion while walking, and to find the correlation between walking speed and arm swing, I attached accelerometers to my
                    lower back, upper arm, and forearm, and measured the angles, velocities, and accelerations. An example of the results are presented in the following video:</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <img src="../img/portfolio/motorized_prosthetic_arm/accelerometer.gif" width="70%">
                    </p>
                    <p class="img_description">Accelerometer sensors - back, shoulder, and elbow accelerations</p>
                    <p>I used the collected data to model the arm motion in the next section of the project.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h4>Modeling a human arm as a double pendulum</h4>
                    <p>To Better understand the motion of a human arm and find a suitable motor to imitate the elbow motion,
                    I modeled the arm as a double pendulum system. I used the system Lagrangian and measured shoulder and elbow
                    angles to find the motion equations and extract the required elbow torque.</p>
                    <p>The double pendulum can be described using the following system sketch, where the masses are located
                    in the center of mass of every link:</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        <img src="../img/portfolio/motorized_prosthetic_arm/double_pendulum_diagram.png" width="35%">
                    </p>
                    <p class="img_description">Modeling the arm as a double pendulum - system sketch</p>
                    <p>The kinetic and potential energy of the system is as follows:
                    $$ KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot m_1 \cdot (\dot{x_1}^2 + \dot{y_1}^2) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot m_2 \cdot (\dot{x_2}^2 + \dot{y_2}^2) $$
                    $$ PE = m_1 \cdot g \cdot y1 + m_2 \cdot g \cdot y_2 $$

                    where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the upper arm and the forearm (respectively), $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the distance from
                    the joint to the center of mass of the upper arm and the forearm (respectively), $g$ is the gravity constant, and:
                    $$ x_1 = R_1 \cdot sin(\theta_1) $$
                    $$ y_1 = -R_1 \cdot cos(\theta_1) $$
                    $$ x_2 = R_1 \cdot sin(\theta_1) + R_2 \cdot sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) $$
                    $$ y_2 = -R_1 \cdot cos(\theta_1) - R_2 \cdot cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) $$
                    </p>
                    <p>The Lagrangian is the difference between the two energies:
                    $$ L(t) = KE - PE $$
                    </p>
                    <p>The Euler-Lagrange equation, the connection between the joints torque to the joints angles, can be computed using the
                    following equation:
                    $$ \tau_i(t) =
                    \biggl(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta_i'}\biggr)' - \frac{\partial L}{\partial \theta_i} $$
                    where $i$ is the joint number.
                    </p>
                    <p>Plugging in the measured angles returns the torque as a function of time. After scanning the maximum torque and velocity
                    over all trials, I could find the maximum requirements for the motor.</p>
                    <p>The following video shows an animation of the arm motion, represented as a double pendulum:</p>

                    <br>

                    <h4>Motor control</h4>
                    <p>To control the motor, I used a 2 layer control system - feedback current and position control. The current was controlled
                    by the ODrive's controller, and the position was controlled by a feedback PID controller (with an optional feedforward component).</p>

                    <p>After tunning the controller, I reached the maximum error goal of 5% from the maximum angle.</p>
