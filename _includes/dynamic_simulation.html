                    <h3>Description</h3>       
                    <p>In this project, I simulated and animated the dynamics of a planar jack-in-a-box system. 
                        <br>The simulation forecast the dynamic of the multi-body system in time, while the bodies experience multiple impacts between each other
                        (impacts between the jack's masses and the boxâ€™s walls).</p>
                    <p>Take a look at the project on my <a href="https://github.com/YaelBenShalom/Simulating-Jack-in-a-Box" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><b>GitHub</b></u></a> page.</p>
                    <h3>Overview</h3>       
                    <p>The dynamic system includes 2 rigid bodies - A squared box and a 4-mass jack, as shown below.
                        <br>On the two bodies acts external forces and gravity, that causes them to move and impact each other. The jack falls down with gravity, while on the box acts an equal
                        and opposite force to gravity that keeps it in it's place. On the box also acts a sinusoidal torque that makes it rotate back and forth in a constant frequency.</p>
                    <p>In order to keep track of the position of the bodies through the simulation, I defined a series of sub-frame for every mass in the system that portray the location
                        of the mass relative to the system's main frame.</p>
                    <p>The following drawing shown the different frames in the system:</p>

                    <p>To simulate the system, I used the Euler-Lagrange equations and the impact laws. There are total of 16 possible impact scenarios (anyone of the jack's masses can impact anyone of the box's walls), and the model can simulates every impact possible.</p>
                    <p>All of the impacts in this system are ideal elastic impacts.</p>
